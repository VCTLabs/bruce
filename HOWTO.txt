How to write presentations using Bruce the Presentation Tool
============================================================

Bruce presentations are written as plain-text files in the
ReStructuredText format with some extensions. See the examples
folder \*.rst files for some samples, the simplest being
"simple.rst" which displays plain text sentences centered
on a white background::

    .. style::
       :layout.valign: center
       :align: center
       :font_size: 36

    Text displayed centered on the default white background.

    ----

    A new page, separated from the previous using the four
    dashes.

    Ut enim ad minim veniam.

    A Page Title
    ------------

    Pages may optionally have titles which are displayed
    centered at the top by default.

and so on.


More Detail
-----------

Pages in Bruce are defined as being the text contained in a section
or between transitions (horizontal rules, ``----``). It is important that a blank
surrounds the transition line, otherwise ReST might try to interpret it as a 
title (which will often mean resulting in a parsing error). See
``examples/test_sectioning.rst`` for a file that mixes section-based and transition-based
page delimiting.

Bruce supports a large amount of ReStructuredText:

- inline markup for emphasis, strong, superscript, subscript and literal
- literal blocks
- bullet and enumerated lists (including nesting)
- definition lists
- images - inline and stand-alone
- page titles (section headings)

The rendering stylesheet may be altered on the fly using the ".. style::"
directive. Changes made in this way are immediate and affect all subsequent
text. The exception to this is the "layout" style which applies to the
entire current and subsequent pages.

The page decoration may also be defined on the fly. Unlike the stylesheet
which may be modified, the page decoration must be specified entirely with
each directive. The decoration directive applies to the current and subsequent
pages. The decoration also controls the placement of the page title.

A blank decoration directive ".. decoration::" will result in
the default decoration having a white background and the page title centered
at the top of the page.

**images**
    A ``:width:`` and/or ``:height:`` may be specified to scale the image when displayed.
    If only one is specified then the image's other dimension will be scaled
    to ensure the image aspect ration is retained.

**video**
    Embedded in the same manner as images, and may be scaled in the same way.
    Additionally video may be asked to loop using the ``:loop:`` flag.
