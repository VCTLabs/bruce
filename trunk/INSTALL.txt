If you're just a user of Bruce then you should not be using these instructions.
Please download the application version for your operating system from
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bruce>:

- Linux "bruce-<version>-linux.zip" (eg. "bruce-3.1-linux.zip")
- Windows "bruce-<version>-windows.zip" (eg. "bruce-3.1-windows.zip")
- OS X "bruce-<version>-osx.zip" (eg. "bruce-3.1-osx.zip")
  

If you MUST install Bruce (ie. you're a system package mantainer) then these
instructions are for you.

Bruce REQUIRES these minimum versions:

- Python__ 2.5
- docutils__ 0.4.1 (including its bundled roman.py)
- pyglet__ 1.1.2
- Cocos__ 0.3.0

__ http://www.python.org/
__ http://docutils.sf.net/
__ http://pyglet.org/
__ http://cocos2d.org/

And you may also optionally install:

- Pygments__ 0.10
- Tkinter for the GUI interface (Tkinter is usually bundled with Python)

__ http://pygments.org/

To install Bruce, run::

    # python setup.py install

This will install a shell script "bruce" which may be used to run the
application.
