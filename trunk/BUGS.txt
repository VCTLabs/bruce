KNOWN BUGS

- line break before tables / interpreters in list items
- table backgroun not being faded correctly; also text appears to be rendered mutiple times
- transitions sometimes get confused when in fullscreen
- test_interpreter (first page) shows resizing issues
- indentation of list item content varies when list enumeration gets wide
- footer doesn't handle color changes
- interpreter focus when multiple in page (should follow mouse)
  focus should be in first on page, then follow mouse if it changes focus
- need additional set_active(boolen) on elements to disable plugins /
  interpreter when they're not displayed
- elements placed/removed TONS during list fade (& construction)
  table performance sucks ass because of this

  Options:

  1. layout all page scenes at startup,
  2. modify IncrementalTextLayout._update_vertex_lists to not delete the
     lines being changed but rather update them, or
  3. extreme option is to avoid IncrementalTextLayout and switch to a
     customised TextLayout that knows how to change colors.
