KNOWN BUGS

- transitions mostly get confused when in fullscreen
- test_interpreter (first page) shows resizing issues
- indentation of list item content varies when list enumeration gets wide
- footer doesn't handle color changes

- interpreter focus when multiple in page (should follow mouse)
  focus should be in first on page, then follow mouse if it changes focus

- table & interpreter don't handle set_alpha

- FADE transition causes the new page to be on_enter()'ed TWICE
  (and the outgoing one to be on_exit()'ed twice too)

- plugin (and other) elements placed/removed TONS during list fade
