'Testing curly-double-quotes'

'Twas started with the incorrect quote

But isn't this one correct?

And some ... elipsis, en -- dash and em --- dash.

Make sure::

   "this pre section is not transformed"

   -- double dash

   --- triple dash

   ... dot dot dot

Unfortunately \"escaped quotes\" don't work.
