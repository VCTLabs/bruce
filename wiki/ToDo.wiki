#summary Missing Bruce features

=Interface=

Many variables:

1. fullscreen or not
2. main window showing current page
3. other window with scaled current page
4. other window showing source progressively
5. other window showing next page
6. source edit window


=Transitions=

  # Need to be able to ask the next page to prepare for rendering. This will be done automatically when the current page is idle.
  # Pages should be able to indicate when they are idle.

And then:

Wipe, slide, rotate can be done with projections:

  # transform
  # render current
  # transform
  # render next

Fade may be done using a copy of the color buffer:

  # copy current as old
  # render next
  # render old with alpha

More advanced transitions using textures:

  # render current to texture
  # render next to texture
  # animate


Page transition ideas:

  * fade between
  * fade via black
  * flip around over middle v/h
  * rotate "cube" v/h
  * slide (out or in or both)
  * peel from side / corner
  * progressive blur in / out (via shader)
  * typographic:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejweI0EQpX8  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf8olcM0z4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX7N58df0j0  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhAdFoEge1c
