#summary Missing Bruce features

Bugs:

  # image border when zoomed up is still dodgy (check image placement - might not be pixel-aligned)

Transitions:

  # Need to be able to ask the next page to prepare for rendering. This will be done automatically when the current page is idle.
  # Pages should be able to indicate when they are idle.

And then:

Wipe, slide, rotate can be done with projections:

  # transform
  # render current
  # transform
  # render next

Fade may be done using a copy of the color buffer:

  # copy current as old
  # render next
  # render old with alpha

More advanced transitions using textures:

  # render current to texture
  # render next to texture
  # animate


Page transition ideas:

  * fade between
  * fade via black
  * flip around over middle v/h
  * rotate "cube" v/h
  * slide (out or in or both)
  * peel from side / corner
  * progressive blur in / out (via shader)
