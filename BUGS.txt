KNOWN BUGS

- transitions sometimes get confused when in fullscreen
- test_interpreter (first page) shows resizing issues
- indentation of list item content varies when list enumeration gets wide
- footer doesn't handle color changes
- better places to put screenshots...
- interpreter focus when multiple in page (should follow mouse)
  focus should be in first on page, then follow mouse if it changes focus
- interpreter doen't handle set_opacity
- elements placed/removed TONS during list fade (& construction)
  table performance sucks ass because of this
  (could I pre-layout all page content and then just hide pages???
  could do second display then...)
