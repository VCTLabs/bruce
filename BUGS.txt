KNOWN BUGS

- transitions mostly get confused when in fullscreen
- test_interpreter (first page) shows resizing issues
- indentation of list item content varies when list enumeration gets wide
- footer doesn't handle color changes

- interpreter focus when multiple in page (should follow mouse)
  focus should be in first on page, then follow mouse if it changes focus

- interpreter doen't handle set_opacity

- table contents double-rendered during list fade
- table decorations not faded in list fade

- elements placed/removed TONS during list fade (& construction)
  - table performance sucks ass because of this

(could I pre-layout all page content and then just hide pages??? could do second display then...)
