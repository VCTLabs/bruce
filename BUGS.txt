KNOWN BUGS

- need avbin & pygments on dev laptop
- IMPLEMENT set_active(boolen) on elements (interpreter done)

- transitions sometimes get confused when in fullscreen
- test_interpreter (first page) shows resizing issues
- interpreter rendering gets garbled on scroll
- indentation of list item content varies when list enumeration gets wide
- footer doesn't handle color changes
- interpreter focus when multiple in page (should follow mouse)
  focus should be in first on page, then follow mouse if it changes focus
- elements placed/removed TONS during page & list fade (& construction)
  video playback stutters and table performance sucks ass because of this

  Options:

  1. layout all page scenes at startup,
  2. modify IncrementalTextLayout._update_vertex_lists to not delete the
     lines being changed but rather update them, or
  3. extreme option is to avoid IncrementalTextLayout and switch to a
     customised TextLayout that knows how to change colors.
